In this app I should:
- register
- select a library (location)
- see all available books (done)
- "rent" a book for a certain duration
- see when a book should be back (done)
- each book should be link[ed] to one or multiple genres (done)
- search book by genre (done)

Requirements:
- pushed on Github with a really [detailed] Readme to understand how it works
- have a dockerfile or docker compose or Vagrant file to start the project (done)
- database: postgres or mysql (done)
- front end: not ugly please! Something simple like Bootstrap is enough - no need to do single app, a classic MVC / "template" app is enough
